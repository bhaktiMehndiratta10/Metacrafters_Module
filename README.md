# Degen Gaming Token (DG) Smart Contract

## Overview

The Degen Gaming Token (DG) is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token contract that allows for the creation, transfer, and management of a gaming-related digital token. This contract provides basic functionalities such as token transfers, approvals, allowances, minting, and burning.

## Contract Details

- **Name:** Degen Gaming Token
- **Symbol:** DG
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** Variable (initially set during deployment)
- **Owner:** Contract deployer's address

## Features

1. **Constructor**
   The contract is initialized with an initial supply of tokens. The initial supply is multiplied by 10^18 (decimals) to set the total supply of tokens.

2. **Token Transfers**
   Users can transfer tokens to other addresses, provided they have a sufficient balance. Transfers emit the `Transfer` event.

3. **Approvals and Allowances**
   Users can approve another address (spender) to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. This allowance mechanism is commonly used for interactions with other contracts.

4. **Transfer From**
   An address with an approved allowance can transfer tokens on behalf of another address. The transferred amount is deducted from the spender's allowance.

5. **Minting**
   The contract owner can mint additional tokens, increasing the total supply. This feature is restricted to the contract owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier.

6. **Burning**
   Token holders can burn (destroy) their own tokens, which reduces the total supply. This can be useful for managing token supply over time.

7. **Modifiers**
   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts certain functions to be callable only by the contract owner.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**
   Deploy the contract, providing the initial supply of tokens as a parameter.

2. **Interacting with the Token**
   Users can interact with the token by using the provided functions:
   - `transfer`: Transfer tokens to another address.
   - `approve`: Approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens.
   - `transferFrom`: Allow a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner.
   - `mint`: Only the owner can mint new tokens.
   - `burn`: Token holders can burn their own tokens.

3. **Events**
   The contract emits events for various actions, such as token transfers (`Transfer`) and approval changes (`Approval`).
